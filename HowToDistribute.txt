We need to Prepare Master and Worker Machines.

1. First:
    -> Make sure MPJ Express and Java is installed.
    So we need to put the Paths 'MPJ_HOME' and 'JAVA_HOME'
1. Set the MPJ_HOME Environment Variable
Click on "New..." under the "User variables for devne" section.

Add a new system variable:

Variable name: MPJ_HOME
Variable value: The path to the directory where MPJ Express is installed.
Example: C:\path\to\mpj-express (replace with the actual path where you extracted MPJ Express).
Click "OK" to save the new variable.

2. Edit the Path Environment Variable
Find and select the Path variable under the "User variables for devne" section, and then click on "Edit..."
Add a new entry:
New entry: %MPJ_HOME%\bin
This allows you to run MPJ Express commands from any directory in your command prompt.
Click "OK" to save the changes.
3. Verify JAVA_HOME Environment Variable
You already have JAVA_HOME set, so just ensure that it points to the correct JDK installation path.

Example: C:\Users\devne\Downloads\jdk-22_windows-x64_bin\jdk-22.0.2 (ensure this path is correct and that it points to where your JDK is installed).
Edit the Path Environment Variable for JAVA_HOME:

You should have %JAVA_HOME%\bin already added to your Path variable, which allows you to run Java commands from any directory.

Then in the Master Machine we need to create a .jar file of this
1. We open the Cmd (Terminal) and look for the project Dir.
2. Then once you are there -> CREATE A JAR FILE WITH BELOW COMMAND
jar cvf VRP-89221061.jar -C out/production/VRP-89221061 .

C:\Users\devne\OneDrive\Desktop\VRP-89221061>javac -cp "C:\Users\devne\Downloads\mpj\lib\mpj.jar;src" -d out/production/VRP-89221061 src/main/java/distributed/Master.java src/main/java/distributed/Worker.java src/main/java/main_components/*.java

C:\Users\devne\OneDrive\Desktop\VRP-89221061>jar cvf VRP-89221061.jar -C out/production/VRP-89221061 .

Then also in the same directory add a machines.txt file in order to Run the Workers (find their ips)
192.168.1.blah

IMPORTANT IS FO THEM TO BE IN A SIMILAR TO SAME DIRECTORY

FOR WORKER MACHINES:
=> GO TO THE DIRECTORY WHERE %MPJ_HOME%\bin
AND RUN THE mpjdaemon.bat -boot == for loading, -status == to check if works, -halt == when finished connecting


FOR MACHINE:
Case: If MPJ_HOME still not working create the environment:
$env:MPJ_HOME = "C:\Users\devne\Downloads\mpj"
Finally you can run the last command:

.\mpjrun.bat -np 2 -dev niodev -machinesfile machines.txt -cp "C:\mpj\lib\mpj.jar;C:\VRP-89221061\out\production\VRP-89221061" main.java.distributed.Master

Read this file in order to configure on master and worker machines! ;)
